![Branches in action: Tree-search visualization for code generation with self-correction in the HumanEval benchmark](https://storage.googleapis.com/normal-blog-artifacts/systerm2/tot_demo.gif)

***Tree-search visualization during code generation.** We visualize a reasoning algorithm which learns from feedback, automatically correcting itself by analyzing error tracebacks to refine its solutions. In this case, we benchmark Python programming problems from the HumanEval dataset.*

## About

Branches is an AI tool for graph-based prototyping of advanced algorithms for LLM reasoning and planning -- like Tree of Thoughts and Reflexion. Branches is adapted from [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux).

Designed for researchers and developers, it allows users to directly interact with AI reasoning processes, streamlining the exploration of complex coding challenges and strategic problem-solving.

### Code Generation (HumanEval)

Branches automatically expands decision trees to solve programming problems from the [HumanEval dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval), visualizing reasoning chains and facilitating self-correction through error tracebacks. This is found on the `main` branch and is currently hosted. 

### Game of 24
Branches includes a specialized evaluation mechanism for the [Game of 24 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)), leveraging a scoring system to enhance breadth-first search (BFS) by prioritizing promising paths. This is found on the `game-of-24` branch.

## Features

- [x] üå≥ **Automated Tree Expansion**: Leveraging Tree of Thoughts for dynamic expansion in problem-solving.
- [x] üß† **Pre-loaded Prompts**: Curated for search-based reasoning to solve specific problems.
- [x] üíª **Code Interpretation**: Instant execution and error analysis for self-correcting AI-generated code.
- [x] üîç **Scoring Mechanism**: Advanced BFS for the Game of 24 with node evaluation for search optimization.
- [x] üìä **Interactive Visualization**: Graphical representation of tree searches for easy analysis and education. Largely adapted from [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux).

## Usage

To get started with Branches, you can either visit [code-gen-tree.vercel.app](https://code-gen-tree.vercel.app) for the hosted version or run it locally by following the instructions below.

## Deploy to Vercel
```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

## Running Locally
For local development, checkout the `local-dev` branch. This is slightly modified to use Flask to serve the code interpreter API.

Setup repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/normal-computing/branches.git
git checkout local-dev
```

**Frontend (User Interface):**
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Backend (Code Interpreter):**
```
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/interpreter.py
```
