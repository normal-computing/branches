## About

BrainBranch, forked from [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux), is a power tool for visualizing tree-search algorithms like Tree-of-Thoughts.

In this example, we visualize code-generation as a tree-search for finding solutions to Python programs in the HumanEval benchmark. Generated code that fails to compile or pass tests, is reflected upon through its error traceback to generate a reasoning chain and self-correct.
