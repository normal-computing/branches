![BrainBranch in action: Tree-search visualization for code generation with self-correction in the HumanEval benchmark](https://storage.googleapis.com/normal-blog-artifacts/systerm2/tot_demo.gif)

*The GIF above demonstrates BrainBranch's tree-search visualization during code generation. It shows how the system automatically corrects itself by analyzing error tracebacks to refine its solutions to Python programming problems from the HumanEval dataset.*

## About

BrainBranch, forked from [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux), is an advanced tool for visualizing and shaping the decision-making of large language models (LLMs) through tree-search algorithms like Tree of Thoughts. Designed for researchers and developers, it allows users to directly interact with AI reasoning processes, streamlining the exploration of complex coding challenges and strategic problem-solving.

### Code Generation (HumanEval)
BrainBranch automatically expands decision trees to solve programming problems from the [HumanEval dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval), visualizing reasoning chains and facilitating self-correction through error tracebacks. This is found on the `main` branch and is currently hosted. 

### Game of 24
BrainBranch includes a specialized evaluation mechanism for the [Game of 24 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)), leveraging a scoring system to enhance breadth-first search (BFS) by prioritizing promising paths. This is found on the `game-of-24` branch.

## Core Technical Features

- üå≥ **Automated Tree Expansion**: Leveraging Tree of Thoughts for dynamic expansion in problem-solving.
- üß† **Pre-loaded Prompts**: Curated for search-based reasoning to solve specific problems.
- üíª **Code Interpretation**: Instant execution and error analysis for self-correcting AI-generated code.
- üîç **Scoring Mechanism**: Advanced BFS for the Game of 24 with node evaluation for search optimization.
- üìä **Interactive Visualization**: Graphical representation of tree searches for easy analysis and education. Thank you to [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux) for this.
